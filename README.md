## About the project
HooBank is a modern UI/UX website made with ReactJS & Tailwind CSS during a follow along video by JavaScript Mastery.

## How to run this project
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
to install all the dependencies of the project.

With the dependencies installed, you can run:
### `npm run dev`
to run the application.

### **WARNING!**
The navbar items are the only clickable things in the project, everything else that appear to be clickable are only there for the design, but they are not functional. If I ever decide to return to this project I will create something to make them functional and I will remove the waring from the README file.
